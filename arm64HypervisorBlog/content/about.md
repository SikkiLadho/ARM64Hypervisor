Hi. I'm Mushahid Hussain. I have a passion for writing and learning about operating systems, hypervisors and virtualization. I have created this blog to write about baremetal hypervisor, specific to ARMv8-A architecture. You can learn more about my work on [Github](https://github.com/sikkiladho) or reach out to me on [Linkedin](www.linkedin.com/in/mhussainshar).
